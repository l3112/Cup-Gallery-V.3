    <div class="intro">I have wanted to do this for a long time,<br> and now I have the proper know-how ✨ You can find the post <a href="https://www.runtcpip.com"> here</a> on Feb. 6th. <p>
        This is not all of them. I didn't want to overwhelm anybody. I have enough for a part 2.

    <h3>"Alice in Wonderland" Queen of Hearts Mug</h3>
    <div class="flav">Fun fact: This is not the only Queen of Hearts mug I own. The other one actually kicked off my Disney mug collection. It was the 2012 Villains set. This one is from another set in 2013. I also have the Rapunzel one from this series. Dishwasher and Microwave safe.</div>
</div>
<div class="col">
    
    <img src="fr.jpg" alt='Elsa mug'><br>
    <h3>"Frozen" Elsa Mug</h3>

<p></p>
    <div class="flav"><i>"Where the northwind meets the sea."</i> While this mug is from the first movie...I don't like the first movie! I like the music in the second. But I love this mug; It's the biggest one I own, and worth the price. There was a variant with Anna but we're all here for Elsa. Dishwasher and Microwave safe. </div>
</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="co.jpg" alt="coco mug"><br>
    <h3>"Coco" Mug</h3>
    <div class="flav">From extremely big to extremely small. There are lots of glittery embellishments, while nice,  makes this mug neither dishwasher or microwave safe, no matter what the website says. </div>
</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="hp.jpg" alt=''><br>
    <h3>Harry Potter - House Slytherin</h3>
    <div class="flav"> Ignore the author; The first 7 Harry Potter books have earned their place in history. The worldbuilding is great, and after being sorted by Pottermore, I happily take on Slytherin pride. If only a certain asshole didn't make it a House full of wizard supremacists. Dishwasher and Microwave safe. </div>
</div>
<div class="col">
   <img src="lk.jpg" alt="Lion King"><br>
<p> <h3>Presentation of The King - "The Lion King"</h3></p>
    <div class="flav">The other side has Baby Simba, but I was always more fond of Rafiki. I love the curved lip. It's my dream to drink decaf coffee from this mug in Animal Kingdom lodge.  Dishwasher and Microwave Safe. </div>
   
    
</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="batb.jpg" alt="Beauty and the Beast"><br>
    <h3>"Beauty and The Beast"</h3>
    <p>
        <div class="flav">Another mug from a yearly collection, I just don't recall what it was. I think "Disney Couples Romance". There are full body portraits on the other side. I also have the "Aladdin" variant with Aladdin and Jasmine. Dishwasher and Microwave safe. </div>
    
</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="teng.jpg" alt="The Emperor's New Groove"><br>
    <h3>"The Emperor's New Groove 20th Anniversary"</h3>
    <div class="flav">This is one mug where the price is ridiculous, but the gimmicks are so fun, you almost forgive them for it. The little bottle spins! The entire mug is full of cool concept art for the characters! The inside has Yzma's quote on turning Kuzco into a llama! <br><br> The Tarzan 20th anniversary was one year before, in 2019. That got paid dust. Really would have liked a mug from my favorite Disney movie. Not Dishwasher or Microwave safe, but I forgive it.</div>
</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="lns.jpg" alt="Stitch schematic mug"><br>
    <h3>Stitch Schematic Mug</h3>
    <div class="flav">Another mug with concept art, this was part of an older collection (2014?). I remember other characters including Lady and Pinocchio (which is a very underrated movie). The handle accent color is between Stitch's body and the lighter blue around his eyes. There is molding on the very bottom. Dishwasher and Microwave safe.</div> 
</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="rbti.jpg" alt=''><br>
    <p> <h3>"Ralph Breaks The Internet" travel Mug</h3></p>
        <div class="flav">Comes with a pink top (somewhere). Can be put in the dishwasher, but the decals will scratch. While it isn't genuine insulation, there are two layers within, and the inner one can crack if you drop it. Ask me how I know.</div>
       
        
</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="mul.jpg"> <br>
    <h3>Disney Wisdom - "Mulan"</h3>
    <div class="flav"> This and the following mugs were from the 2019 yearly collection, Disney Wisdom. For some reason (a lot of Mulan merch is gaudy and this is the rare exception), everyone really wanted this mug, which means people were happy to try and sell it for 60$. Shoutout to my seller for the better deal. Has Mushu and Crick-ee on the other side. </div>
</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="cind.jpg"> <br>
    <h3>Disney Wisdom - "Cinderella" </h3>
    <div class="flav">This was the mug I really wanted, and waited all year to buy. So I bought it. The gold on pink does not photograph well - It says 'Even Miracles Take a Little Time', with The Fairy Godmother and Gus-Gus on the other side. It also stacks with the Mulan mug above! Both are Dishwasher and Microwave safe.</div>

</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="mal.jpg"> <br>
    <h3>Disney Animator Collection - "Sleeping Beauty"</h3>
    <div class="flav"> It has Maleficent, and I like the stone pattern of the mug, and the cute Animator style art. It says "Scaring up Another Spell" on the inside. Did you know, there was D23 2019 exclusive Animator Dolls of Maleficent and Ursula? Handles on both of these mugs are pretty uncomfortable with the thorns and ridges, but that's style for you.</div>

</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="tlm1.jpg" alt=" The little mermaid Ursula 1"><br>
    <h3>Disney Animator Collection - "The Little Mermaid"</h3>
    <div class="flav"> The fact that this mug has the same sillouette of Ursula herself is great. The other side says "Me, Scary?". Look at the handle imitating a shell in its texture. More clever styles like this, please. But that would requite body diversity, and I don't think we can have that so much. Both are Dishwasher and Microwave safe.</div>

</div>

<div class="col">
    <img src="mirror.jpg"> <br>
    <h3>"Snow White" - 'Mirror, Mirror, on the Wall....'</h3>
    <div class="flav">These two mugs are part of a set. They're extremely tall, and marked as hand wash only, but I don't think they would suffer ill effects from it. Don't hold me to it, because god knows I'm not going to risk it.</div>
</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="fair.jpg"> <br>
    <h3>'...who's the fairest of them all?'</h3>
    <div class="flav"> The all encompassing black that melds into Snow's hair is *chef's kiss*. It's some kind of 50's art deco style I can't put a name to, but you've seen it before. I wish the mug was maybe a shiny red instead of gold, but it does match the words on the back. </div>
</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="vil.jpg"> <br>
    <h3>"Villains" "Queen of Hearts"</h3>
    <div class="flav">Here is the one that started it all - You can see where I broke a leg off and repaired it with gorilla glue. Surprisingly, it it still dishwasher safe (if a little lopsided).</div>
</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="moana.jpg" alt="moana"><br>
    <h3>"Moana" Mug</h3>
    <div class="flav"> The handle is Maui's fishhook. That is so ridiculously clever. A killer touch would be to have the Heart of Te Fiti as the base of the mug's inside. Dishwasher and Microwave safe.</div>
</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="mick.jpg" alt="micky white and gold"><br>
    <h3>White and Gold Mickey Motif</h3>
    <div class="flav"> Simple and elegant, like the main mouse himself. Got this from Target during the [insert number]th anniversary in about 2018. Dishwasher and Microwave safe, but the handle has begun to flake.</div>

</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="al.jpg"> <br>
    <h3>"Aladdin" Mug</h3>
    <div class="flav">Here is that other Disney Romance Couples mug. I don't think the pink does them any favors. Jasmine's teal would have been better. Or white! Dishwasher and Microwave safe.</div>
</div>
<div class="col">
     
    <img src="white.jpg" alt="very pale Jasmine Mug"><br>
    <h3>Jasmine Mug</h3>
    <div class="flav"> This was from another nameless collection. I love the style of the mug, the flared rim is interesting and says "Open your heart to a whole new world". What I don't love is the whitewashing. Her skin is warmer, browner than this. Dishwasher and Microwave safe.
     </div>
</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="mu.jpg" alt="Monsters University mug"><br>
    <h3>"Monsters' University" Collegiate Mug</h3>
    <div class="flav"> Has a matching Spirit Jersey that I always regret not getting. Dishwasher and Microwave safe. </div>

</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="tink.jpg" alt="Tinkerbell Mug"><br>
    <h3>"Peter Pan" Tinkerbell Mug</h3>
    <div class="flav">The body of the mug could use a little more clarity. A sharp 'V' shape would have been nice, but I do like the paisley print. It's a wide shape with a fairy-like wing handle. Dishwasher and Microwave safe.</div>

</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="hire.jpg" alt="plain grey mug"><br>
    <h3>'Tired and Ready to be Hired' Mug</h3>
    <div class="flav"><a href="https://www.runtcpip.com/2020/04/the-updated-what-im-looking-for-in-role.html"> Just saying.</a> Dishwasher and Microwave safe.</div>

</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="tlm2.jpg" alt="Ursula Mug"><br>
    <h3>Ursula Mug</h3>
    <div class="flav">Another wide, simple mug with various screenshots interspersed from "The Little Mermaid".  I haven't used it in years, and "The Little Mermaid" is already represented above, so I'm open to selling it. Dishwasher and Microwave safe (Probably).</div>

</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="hh.jpg" alt="tall tumbler"><br>
    <h3>Tervis "Hercules" Hades Tumbler</h3>
    <div class="flav">This is an AMAZING design. You have that 80s rock design of Hades on the front, and this cool shiiny imprint of Pain and Panic on the back. The only issue is how easily the inner container picks up smells. It took about 2 months to get a coffee scent out of it, and it's still in the metal insides. Hint: You have to remove that black plastic strip of the Hammer Lid and clean it. Hand-wash, but it's such a hassle. </div>

</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="cap1.jpg" alt="white mug, goat"><br>
    <h3>Capricorn Mug</h3>
    <div class="flav"> Also from Target. Dishwasher and Microwave safe.</div>

</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="bay.jpg"> <br>
    <h3>"Big Hero 6" - Armored Baymax</h3>
    <div class="flav">It's on the smaller side, but back in 2014, we were charged reasonable amounts for these mugs. The overarching curves that kind of incline inside and work with the general roundness of Baymax is impressive. It's very blobular, and feels like the opposite of a starkly sharp square "Incredibles" art style. Microwave and Dishwasher safe. </div>

</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="poi.jpg"> <br>
    <h3>"Snow White" Poison Apple Drink Cup</h3>
    <div class="flav"> Yes, it has a straw like a child's cup. But it's also glow in the dark. So who wins here? I do. Not Dishwasher safe. </div>

</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="ed.jpg"> <br>
    <h3>"Incredibles 2" Edna Mode Cup and Saucer Set</h3>
    <div class="flav">I store this seperately from the other mugs and ... forget about it often. This is not a good example of the sharp artstyle of The Incredibles franchise, but it is a good example of the 60's slants and 'space-age' mindset. The cup is Microwave and Dishwasher safe, the plate is dishwasher safe. </div>

</div>
<div class="col">
    <img src="tang.jpg"> <br>
    <h3>"Tangled" Braided Handle Mug</h3>
    <div class="flav">Part of that first set with the Queen of Hearts. There is also a Snow White mug in this same style I own. I remember there was also a Belle and Jasmine one. Dishwasher and Microwave Safe.</div>
